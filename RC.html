            WeeklyUpdate - From Hero To Zero
        </h2>
        <p>
            This week has been such a roller coaster. From waiting around a month to get my final part in (TEOSAW STEELE 5" DRONE FRAME) due to the UPS Driver strike going on right now. To frying my ESC on my drone, breaking off an antenna on my RP3 reciever, and finally getting in the camera mount I needed for my fpv camera and it being too big.
            This week has been eventfull to say the least.
        </p>

            To start off no I'm not trying to destroy my $500 drone the first week I have it. I have been treating it better than any kid
            I would ever watch. I'm just joking...sorta... .It all started about 2 weeks ago when I went up to Colorado to 
            see my Grandparents. I got the final pieces to my drone and decided to take them up there 
            to finish it up and fly it out on the golf course out the back side of there house. My drone I made consist of the Speedy Bee V3 F7 Stack, RadioMaster RP3 Reciever,
            XING-E Pro 1800kv Brushless Motors, and all of that on a TEOSAW STEELE 5" Frame. It is ment for 6s batteries but as of now I'm just using 4s ZEEE Lipo Batteries. If you would
            like to make or use some of the same parts links are down in the "Used This Week Store". And if you don't mind
            using those links because I get a little bit back and it helps me to keep projects going like this THANK YOU!!  
        </p>

            So I did happen ran into some issues but I was able to gladly get some wonderful help trouble 
            shooting it with the FPV Community on Discord. And found out that it was just the fact that 
            my ideling for my drone was just to slow. But finally I had my drone ready one day and decided 
            it was a good idea to take to the skies and fly it. There was no wind, rain, or even clouds.
            I started to whip that thing around. I went above and beyond up until I looked down and saw my battery
            it. My battery had went from 13.4v (A safe voltage for 4s Lipo Batteries) to 9.0v in .04 seconds it seemed like.
            I did my best to land gently but it was all hands on deck to land this space craft quick and steady seeing how I 
            really didn't feel like busting back out my poor wallet and making it cough up another $40 for some batteries.
            Especially right after the first flight. In doing so I dropped it maybe dead no throtle 15 feet in the air and it bounced 
            a couple times. But this captain had done it. He had just landed his first emergency landing with a drone 
            with minor to no damage on anything.... or so we thought.....
        </p>

        <p>
            Bringing the drone back to my workbench *cough* The coffe table *cough* I did a through look through of everything, as you 
            are supposed to after such a hard landing. But being sure nothing was wrong after such the confident landing I was just glancing 
            and believed it was all fine. That was until I was walking back out to the field/golf course, when I saw a wire hanging.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was all going good I was speeding around and doing so many flips.
